https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39471072/how-to-create-a-local-push-destination-on-a-hard-disk-using-git

Go to the folder you want to have your remote in

$ cd /path/to/my-remote
Create a bare repository there via git init

$ git init --bare
Go to the repository you want to work in and add a new remote pointing to the previously created repository via git remote add

$ git remote add <name-of-remote> /path/to/my-remote
After these steps you should be able to push to your new remote <name-of-remote>

$ git push -u <name-of-remote> master
Where -u is used to set the upstream of your branch, only needed the first time you push.
---------------------------
Run the following on local branch and remote (ext hdd) branch before pushing to new origin:
git branch -M main
git lfs install
