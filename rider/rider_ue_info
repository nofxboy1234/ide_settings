Checking if key/button is held down:
	PlayerController.IsInputKeyDown(FKey key) const;

If a variable is removed from a c++ class -> Press "Compile" in UE to refresh BP class
If adding a variable to a c++ class -> UE seems to refresh it automatically		
Changing values in constuctor methods, or at initialization in header file, crashes UE editor,
so close Editor if doing this.
